I have a car, and it changed how I plan normal weekdays. Grocery trips that used to require timing and carrying now happen in one loop after work.

Owning a car also added small responsibilities that never stop: fuel, tire pressure, basic cleaning, and remembering service dates. None of it is difficult alone, but together it becomes part of weekly planning.

The best use for me is flexibility. If a friend calls and needs help moving one chair or picking up a package across town, I can just go.

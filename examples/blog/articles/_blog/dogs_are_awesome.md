Dogs are awesome because they bring energy into ordinary days. Even a short walk around the block feels like an event when a dog is excited about every smell and every passing squirrel.

I also respect how direct dogs are. If they are happy, you know it. If they want to play, they bring the toy. That kind of clear mood helps after a long day when my brain is still full of tasks.

Living around dogs has made me better at keeping a routine. They expect movement, fresh air, and attention, and that is usually good for people too.

# Introduction to stbl

stbl is an acronom for "Static Blog".

## What is does

It reads files in a special directory structure and generates a static web site.

![Work-flow](doc/stbl-process.svg)

The directory contains some special files, like css and templates for generating the
html code, a configuration file specific for the site (blog), and directories containing
one file in markup format for each article (post).

## Design Goals

These are the design-goals / primary requirements for the project.

- [x] Creates responsive web-sites "out of the box" for an optimal desktop and mobile user experience.
- [x] Simple to use, friction-less when blogging.
- [x] Command line program, so that blogs can be generated anywhere.
- [x] Few dependencies. Avoid pulling in tons of code to do trivial things.
- [x] Use Markdown for writing.
- [x] Easy to display code snippets, like on github.
- [x] Generate the html code from templates to allow maximum flexibility.
- [x] Fast "time to market" - keep the architecture and code simple.
- [x] Free form javascript. (Javascript can be used by sites generated by the program, but it is not required).
- [x] Generates static HTML5 / responsive websites that can be served by any http server.
- [x] RSS feeds
- [ ] Syntax highlighting of code snippets.
- [ ] Allow more formats than Markdown (in order to make it easy to import sites from existing CMS systems).
- [ ] Optional comments (by some 3rd party services).
- [ ] Optional statistics (no obligatory ties to Google).

## Why

I like to write. I failed to find an existing tool that did the publishing job for me. I tried several popular approaches (like Drupal and Jekyll), but got nowhere. So I decided to spend
a few days making my own program to [get it right](https://lastviking.eu/modern_blogging/index.html).

# License

GPl 3 license. It is Free. Free as in Free Beer. Free as in Free Air.

# How to build

The source code is written in modern C++. It should compile with any recent C++ compiler.
I use Debian Stretch and g++ 6.3.

## Dependencies

System dependencies:
- boost libraries

Git submodules
- lest (for future unit tests and integration tests)
- cpp-markdown (To do the heavy lifting for markdown processing)

## Linux

In order to build, clone the project. Then:

```sh
$ cd stbl
$ git submodule update --init
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

# How to use

## File structure

The top-directory of a site have this layout:

- articles (Directory for content)
- artifacts (Directory for css, icons, banner images, logos etc.)
- files (Optional directory where you can put files you want copied to your website).
- images (Optional directory for images you refer to in your documents)
- templates (Templates to generate the pages in the static site)
- stbl.conf (Site specific configuration)

## Articles

In the articles folder, you can organize articles in a mix of:

- Textfiles in the articles folder itself. These are interpreted as normal articles (blog posts).

- Textfiles in sub-folders, with names starting with an underscore. These are also
  interpreted as normal blog posts. The folders are just a convenience for you to
  organize your posts. For example by subject, year, year+month, or any other
  association that makes sense to you. You can add sub-directories like these in as
  many levels as you wish. However, remember that it's usually best to keep things simple.

- Textfiles in sub-folders *not* starting with an underscore. These are interpreted as a series of related posts. The name of the directory will be listed on your main page as the name of the series, and the posts will be listed in chronological order. (RSS feeds will list the newest articles first).

The articles consist of a header section, and then the actual content. The content
is parsed as Markdown text. This makes it very simple to focus on writing, and
still get nice, structured web pages.

An example:

```text
    ---
    author: jgaa
    tags: example, html, testing
    ---

    ## Testing HTML
    In order to test HTML, you can use the [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

    ## Some code

    ```
    for(auto i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        cout << "The number is ... " i;
    }
    ```
```

In this example we have two header directives, the author (me), and then tags.
Then follows the markup.

## Series

One thing that often annoys me with blogs, is that the articles are always
listed newest first. If you have a series of articles on a subject, you
may want your readers to read them chronologically. That way you can
expand the topic little by little, or tell a story in a consistent way.

Stbl will generate a cover page for the articles in a series, and list the
articles in the series chronologically, oldest first.

As noted before, a series is identified by a directory under articles/ not
starting with an underscore. The name of the series is the name of the
folder. Underscores in the name are translated to spaces. The forder name
"the_adventures_of_my_cat" will result in the series name "The adventures of my cat".

## Static content (about, terms of use, policies)

Some pages, like "About" are special in the way that you probably want a link to them
from the menu, rather having them listed by date.

Stbl has a special template for such pages, stripping them for metadata about authors
and tags. You can even add them to the menu right in the articles header.

Example:

```text
    ---
    menu: About
    template: info.html
    type: info
    ---
    This is just an example / template for a site generated by stbl.

```

## The header Section

The following headers are recognized:

- author: The name of the author of the article. If both authors and author is specified, the author in the 'author' field will appear first among the authors on the generated page.
- authors: A comma-separated list of authors.
- published: When the article was published: A date in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format, or 'no' or 'false' if the article is unpublished. If the value is unset, the system will fall back to the file-date for the article. If the date is set to the future, the article will beheld back1.
Unpublished articles will not be generated. This lets you work on articles long before you
are ready to publish them, by setting the value to "no" or "false".
- updated: When the article was last updated. A date in 'YYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format. If unset, the system will fall back to the file-date for the article.
- expires: When the article expired. A date in 'YYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format. If unset, the article will not expire. Expired articles are not published.
- uuid: uuid of the article
- title: Title of the article. If not specified, the title is deduced from the file-name.
- tags: A comma-separated list of tags.
- abstract: A short abstract of the article, for use in the list of articles.
- template: Template to use when rendering the article. The default is "article.html".
- type: "info" if the article is to be held back from listings (like the About page). Default is blank.
- menu: The name of the menu-item that links to the article. This is typically used for special pages like About or Contact etc.

## Configuration

The configuration-file "stbl.conf" contains site-wide configuration, like
the language used, authors (with contact information), menu structure, and
some other things. See the [example](examples/default/stbl.conf),

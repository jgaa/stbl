Rules for this repository:

1. Never add new crates without being asked.
2. Never bypass existing module boundaries.
3. Prefer small, testable functions.
4. All parsing code must have tests.
5. No filesystem access in stbl_core.
6. No global state.
7. No "TODO" placeholders.
8. No feature creep beyond the prompt.

Rules for this repository:

1. Never add new crates without being asked.
2. Never bypass existing module boundaries.
3. Prefer small, testable functions.
4. All parsing code must have tests.
5. No filesystem access in stbl_core.
6. No global state.
7. No "TODO" placeholders.
8. No feature creep beyond the prompt.
9. Always tests run and make sure that the tests pass.

## Git workflow (important)

- Codex MAY run `git add` for **new files it creates**.
- Codex MUST NOT run `git add` on modified existing files.
- Codex MUST NOT create commits (`git commit`).
- Codex MUST NOT rewrite history.
- All commits are done manually after review.

Rationale:
- New files are easy to miss; adding them helps review.
- Modified files must always be reviewed before staging.
